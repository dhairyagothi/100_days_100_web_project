## 🧾 Introduction

**TodoList App** is a fully functional task management application built as part of the **100 Days 100 Web Projects** challenge. It allows users to create, organize, and track their daily tasks efficiently with features like tag-based categorization, pin/complete/delete actions, and a dark/light theme toggle — all persisted across sessions using `localStorage`.

The project was recently fixed and refactored after a critical bug caused a completely blank UI due to a misconfigured `tailwind.config.js`. It now follows React best practices with immutable state updates, proper TypeScript typings, and clean component architecture.

## 🧑‍💻 Key Implementation Details

### LocalStorage Persistence

Tasks, tags, and dark mode preference are all saved to `localStorage` using a type-safe utility:

```ts
function loadFromStorage<T>(key: string, fallback: T): T {
  try {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : fallback;
  } catch {
    return fallback;
  }
}
```

### Immutable State Updates

All state mutations use immutable patterns to ensure React re-renders correctly:

```ts
// Toggle complete status — immutable map()
const toggleTodoStatus = (id: string) => {
  setTodos(prev =>
    prev.map(todo =>
      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
    )
  );
};
```

### Recurring Task Reset

Tasks marked as recurring automatically reset at midnight using a `useEffect` with the current state via functional updater:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const checkReset = () => {
    const today = new Date().toDateString();
    setTodos(prev =>
      prev.map(todo =>
        todo.recurring && todo.lastReset !== today
          ? { ...todo, completed: false, lastReset: today }
          : todo
      )
    );
  };
  const interval = setInterval(checkReset, 60000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Here's how to get started:

**1. Fork the repository**

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page.

**2. Create a new branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

> Use prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

**3. Make your changes**

Follow the existing code style. Use TypeScript types properly and avoid direct state mutations.

**4. Commit your changes**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add due date support for tasks"
```

**5. Push and open a Pull Request**

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then open a PR against the `main` branch with a clear description of your changes.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Write clean, readable TypeScript — no `any` types
- Use immutable state update patterns (`map`, `filter`, spread)
- Test your changes locally with `npm run dev` before submitting
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Add screenshots in PRs for UI changes
