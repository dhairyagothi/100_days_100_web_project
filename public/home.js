             > this is home.js and this file is broken into 3 parts (

                - variable declaration and slection of html elements
                - Render DOM
                - Search Algorithm and Animation  

             ) 
   
                these parts are broken into more parts:

                    - variable declaration (line : 114 ) 
                        in this the main variable are projectData 
                        and the GRID_LAYOUT . Rest are self explanatory

                            1. projectData (line : 114 ) : 
                                This object is used to store the projects made and then   
                                map them to index.html using render DOM
                                the object structure is: 
                                <day : int> : {
                                    title : string,
                                    tag : string,
                                    href : string,
                                    description : string
                                }

                            2. GRID_LAYOUT (line : 285  ) :
                                When we use the grid layout to render the card randomly , 
                                Somtimes there are gaps felt empty to prevent this we use 
                                grid engine and we randomly select one of the grid config
                                out of the 3 . Now these layout is designed carefully to leave
                                no gaps but we renender one by one it wont look randome 
                                so we make 3 config which leaves no gap and then romdonly 
                                select them so this makes it look random .

                                < screen-breakpoint : [md , lg, xl ] > : <style : [row-tall, col-wide , '' ] > 

                    - Selection of html elements ( Line : 298 ) 
                        This part is self explanatory
                    
                    - Render DOM ( Line : 321 )
                        This part also has two parts inside it (

                            - Component Maker
                            - Append

                        )
                            1. Component Maker ( Line : 321 )
                                In this part we use document.createElement to create a div
                                and assign it style with class property using tailwindcss
                                And give the div a onclick function pointing to the href

                                Now the id plays a important role because when a user searchs 
                                the id tag is used to get the card and give the glow effect

                                next this func arguments are name, title ...... 
                                now we just create the element and return the component 
                                when the func is called

                            2. Append ( Line : 363 ) 
                                In this part as mentioned above we use a math func to generate 
                                random number between 0 and 2 . accordingly we append the component 
                                to the index.html 

                    - Search Algorithm and Animation ( Line : 404 ) 
                        This Part is also in two section ( 

                            - Keyboard Event
                            - Search Func

                        )

                            1 . Keyboard Event ( Line : 404 ) 
                                Over here we use basic JS to listen for keypress and accordingly
                                do some work
                                
                                For inputBox.onkeyup we just listen for an keypress and if so we
                                filter the projectdDtaTitle to find any match

                                In event.key === "Enter" what ever is the first suggestion in the list
                                take us there

                                Supports : ctrl + K or command + K to open search
                            
                            2. Search Func ( Line : 443 ) 
                                This is very simple 
                                    The dis(result) func is used to display the suggestion in a li form
                                    and added onClick and the arg result is just used to map

                                    The show() is used to search UI and activate the search Func

                                    The hide(index) is used to hide the search UI but also passed argument
                                    index to take user to the div
